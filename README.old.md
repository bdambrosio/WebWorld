# WebWorld
Explore AI Minds in Action

WebWorld is a browser-based online 'game' in which players can create a world, populate it with actors, and watch scenarios play out. The game is AI based, and each character has an advanced cognitive framework from which they act and interact. Users can watch the inner thoughts and motivations of every character, see images of them that update with their changing thoughts and emotions, and even converse with any actor while the play is progressing.
